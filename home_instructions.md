# Prompt for Cursor (Claude Sonnet 4.5)

I am building the homepage for my website inside my existing file structure.

## Goal
Create a clean, modern homepage using **HTML + CSS**. You will produce and refine **index.html** and **styles.css** only.

---

## Homepage Requirements

### General Style & Theme
- Background: lighter black / dark charcoal (#111–#181818 range).  
- Overall look: modern, clean, minimalist.  
- Use rounded edges and smooth shadows.  
- Borders and accents should look like **iridescent silver** (subtle gradient shimmer).  
- Typography should feel modern and readable (e.g., Inter, Poppins, or similar).

---

## Navigation Bar
- A centered, rounded rectangle nav bar (pill-style).  
- Contain two items: **Home** and **Benchmarks**.  
- When clicked, the active item should include:  
  - Iridescent border glow  
  - Subtle background gradient  
  - Smooth hover and active transitions  
- Responsive and centered at the top with spacing before the header.

---

## Header Section
A large centered title under the navbar:

**“Find Benchmark Data for Your Start-up”**

Styling should feel prominent with a soft glow or subtle gradient.

---

## 2×2 Grid Section

Create a responsive 2×2 layout arranged as:

**Row 1:**  
- Left: block of text  
- Right: static image  

**Row 2:**  
- Left: static image  
- Right: block of text  

Each block should:
- Have rounded corners  
- Use an iridescent silver border  
- Include padding and spacing  
- Use a subtle shadow or glassmorphism-like effect  
- Be fully responsive (stack to single column on mobile)

Use placeholder images for now, but structure the HTML so real assets can be added later.

---

## Output Expectations
- Provide **full index.html** code using semantic structure.  
- Provide **full styles.css** code, clean and organized.  
- Use intuitive and scalable class names.  
- Match the modern dark-mode + iridescent silver aesthetic.

**Please begin by generating the full HTML and CSS implementation.**
